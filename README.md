# PORTFOLIO

This portfolio website is a dynamic showcase of my skills and projects, designed to provide a clean, interactive,
and professional overview of my work. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
the site highlights my expertise in web development, presenting a visually engaging interface.
By integrating APIs, I enhance the site's functionality and bring real-time data to showcase my skills and achievements in a compelling way.
The responsive design ensures a seamless experience across devices, and the user-friendly layout allows visitors to easily explore my projects, 
experience, and the technologies I specialize in.
